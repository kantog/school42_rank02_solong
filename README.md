This is the fourth project I did for the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network): creating a mini game with the 42 Minilibx library.

From the documentation: 

_Itâ€™s time for you to create a basic computer graphics project! so long will help you improve your skills in the following areas: window management, event handling, colors, textures, and so forth. You are going to use the school graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
The other goals are similar to every other goal for this first year: being rigorous, level up in C programming, use basic algorithms, do some information research, and so forth._

Allowed eternal functions: free, malloc, write, open, close, read, perror, strerror, exit, all Minilibx functions. 

Score: 125/100
